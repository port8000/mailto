MAILTO(1)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            MAILTO(1)



NAME
       mailto - send an e-mail via thunderbird

SYNOPSIS
       mailto [OPTIONS] [NAME ...]

       where NAME are the target email addresses. If any NAME is a known
       shortcut, it will be substituted.

DESCRIPTION
       Send an e-mail via thunderbird.

OPTIONS
       -a, --attach
               attach a file to the e-mail

       -h, -?, --help
               print a help message

       -l, --list-shortcuts
               display all known shortcuts

       -m, -b, --body
               specify the body of the e-mail

       -s, --subject
               specify the subject

SHORTCUTS
       To create short mnemonics for email addresses, create a ~/.mailtorc
       file with the following content:

           $shortcuts{ 'ae' } = 'alice@example.com';
           $shortcuts{ 'be' } = 'bob@example.com';

       Then you can use 'ae' and 'be' as shortcuts for Alice's and Bob's full
       email address.

EXAMPLE
       Say, ae is a shortcut for 'alice@example.com', then a call to

           mailto -s 'Hi' ae

       sends an e-mail to Alice with the subject line 'Hi'.

INSTALLATION
       This program should run almost out of the box. The only non-standard
       CPAN package needed is File::Which. On Debian and Ubuntu, run

           sudo apt-get install libfile-which-perl

       On other systems with the cpan program installed, run

           cpan File::Which

       to install it. Then just drop mailto somewhere in your PATH, make sure,
       the Thunderbird executable is there, too, and you're set. (That is, if
       you can type "thunderbird" on the same prompt as you'd type "mailto",
       and something happens, mailto will work.)
